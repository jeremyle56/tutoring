 For each of the scenarios below
    - give a regular expression to match this class of strings
    - describe the strings being matched using an English sentence


a) encrypted password fields (including the surrounding colons) in a Unix password file entry

d) Names as above, but without the trailing spaces (difficult).
Hint: what are given names composed of, and how many of these things can there be?
