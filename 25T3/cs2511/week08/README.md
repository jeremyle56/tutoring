# Tutorial 8

See [sequence_diagram.md](./sequence_diagram.md) for sequence diagram example.

## A. Sequence Diagrams

1. When would you choose to use a Sequence Diagram instead of a Class Diagram?
2. Describe the key elements of a Sequence Diagram (actor, lifeline, activation bar, messages). Provide one example of each element.
3. How does a Sequence Diagram represent synchronous vs. asynchronous communication? Provide one example each.
4. How would you model conditional behaviour and looping in a sequence diagram? Provide one example each.
5. Discuss how exception handling can be represented in a sequence diagram. Provide an example.
6. Sequence diagrams are often criticised for becoming unreadable in complex systems. What are some techniques to manage this complexity? (see "Sequence Diagram Best Practices").

## B. C4 Model

7. What is the primary purpose of the C4 model in software architecture documentation? Name the four core diagrams in the C4 model, in order of increasing detail.
8. Who is the intended audience for the Context Diagram in the C4 model?
9. How does a Container Diagram differ from a Component Diagram?
10. In a Container Diagram, how would you represent a shared database used by two services?
11. Why separate the web frontend and backend service into different containers?
12. Why is it important to describe the responsibilities of each container in the diagram?
