1. Brainstorm a list of good and poor attributes for team members working on a project.

- Good communication = good, bad communication = bad
- Attitude
- Commitment
- Good spelling
- Good time management
- honest and responsible

2. Suppose there is a member in a group who has gone silent and has yet to complete much of their assigned work. The reason is unknown.

- How should the remaining members approach the situation?

  - Drop the subject
  - Let your tutor know, snitch to jeremy
  - try to reach out

- What can groups do beforehand such that if this occurs, they can manage or minimise the impact?
  - if struggling, try to notice - support them and don't give them more work
  - trying to keep in touch, regular meetings and standups
